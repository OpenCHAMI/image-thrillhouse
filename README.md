# image-thrillhouse

A Go-based image builder that wraps `buildah` to create layered OS images with support for multiple package managers. It is the next-generation replacement for the Python-based image-builder tool used by [OpenCHAMI](https://openchami.org/).

## Features

- **Multiple package managers** — DNF, Zypper, APT (parent builds only), mmdebstrap (scratch builds only)
- **Scratch & parent builds** — build from `scratch` or layer on top of an existing image
- **Multi-arch manifests** — one template, one manifest, per-arch expansion with automatic tag pinning
- **Declarative YAML config** with a `validate` subcommand
- **Multiple publishers** — local container storage, SquashFS, container registry, S3
- **OpenSCAP scanning** — XCCDF benchmarks + OVAL vulnerability evaluation
- **Structured logging** — JSON or text, configurable levels

## Install

### Container (recommended)

The pre-built unified image includes every supported package manager.

```bash
podman pull ghcr.io/openchami/image-thrillhouse:latest
```

See [docs/container-usage.md](docs/container-usage.md) for the full `podman run` invocation and flag explanations.

### RPM (RHEL / Rocky / AlmaLinux / Fedora)

Grab the `.rpm` for your architecture from the [latest release](https://github.com/OpenCHAMI/image-thrillhouse/releases/latest) and install it:

```bash
sudo dnf install ./image-thrillhouse-<version>.<arch>.rpm
```

`buildah` is a hard dependency; `squashfs-tools` and `podman` are recommended/suggested.

### Debian package (Debian / Ubuntu)

Grab the `.deb` for your architecture from the [latest release](https://github.com/OpenCHAMI/image-thrillhouse/releases/latest) and install it:

```bash
sudo apt install ./image-thrillhouse_<version>_<arch>.deb
```

`buildah` is a hard dependency; `squashfs-tools` is recommended and `podman` is suggested.

### From source

For development or unsupported platforms, see [docs/development.md](docs/development.md#building-from-source).

## Quick start

Save the following as `rocky-base.yaml`:

```yaml
meta:
  name: rocky-base
  tags:
    - "9.5"
  from: scratch

layer:
  manager:
    name: dnf
    options:
      releasever: "9"            # required for DNF scratch builds
    config: |
      [main]
      gpgcheck=1
      reposdir=/etc/image-thrillhouse/yum.repos.d
  repos:
    - path: /etc/image-thrillhouse/yum.repos.d/rocky-baseos.repo
      content: |
        [rocky-baseos]
        name=rocky-baseos
        baseurl=https://dl.rockylinux.org/pub/rocky/9/BaseOS/x86_64/os
        enabled=1
        gpgcheck=1
        gpgkey=https://dl.rockylinux.org/pub/rocky/RPM-GPG-KEY-Rocky-9
  actions:
    install:
      packages:
        - kernel
        - systemd

publish:
  - type: local
```

Validate, then build:

```bash
image-thrillhouse validate --config rocky-base.yaml
image-thrillhouse build --config rocky-base.yaml --log-level info
```

`validate` checks YAML syntax, required fields, backend option names/values, and publisher config — useful in CI before a full build.

## A second example: SquashFS output

The `publish` section is a list, so you can fan out to multiple targets in one build. To produce a bootable SquashFS file alongside the local image:

```yaml
publish:
  - type: local
  - type: squashfs
    path: /output/images        # writes <meta.name>-<meta.tags[0]>.squashfs
```

For registry and S3 targets, see [docs/configuration.md#publish](docs/configuration.md#publish).

## Command-line usage

```bash
image-thrillhouse build    --config <path>                    # build a single image
image-thrillhouse build    --manifest <path> --layer <name>   # build one layer from a manifest
image-thrillhouse validate --config <path>                    # validate config without building
image-thrillhouse promote  --manifest <path> --layer <name> --release <tag>   # retag a tested image
image-thrillhouse version                                     # print version info
```

For multi-arch manifests, pass `--arch <x86_64|aarch64|…>`; it defaults to the host arch. See [Manifests](docs/configuration.md#manifests) for the full manifest schema.

Once a content-tagged image has been built and tested, `promote` gives it a human-readable release tag without rebuilding. See [Promoting a release tag](docs/promote.md).

Global flags:

- `--log-level` — `debug` | `info` | `warn` | `error` (default `info`). `debug` adds build detail (created containers, written files, full package lists) without container-runtime internals.
- `--log-format` — `json` | `text` | `textblock` (default `textblock`)
- `--container-debug` — also emit debug output from the container runtime libraries (buildah, containers/storage). Very verbose; mainly useful for diagnosing storage, mount, or isolation problems.

## Recommendations

- **Start with `validate`.** Run `image-thrillhouse validate` in CI before any build — it catches typos in backend options and missing required fields before you pay for a long package download.
- **Use the unified container.** It already has DNF, Zypper, APT, and mmdebstrap. Switching distros is a config change, not an image change. See [docs/container-usage.md](docs/container-usage.md#why-a-unified-image).
- **Always set `releasever` for DNF scratch builds.** This is the most common scratch-build failure mode. See [docs/configuration.md](docs/configuration.md#backend-options).
- **Use `remove_packages` to slim images.** Drop debug packages, docs, and unused firmware in the same step that installs the base — see [docs/configuration.md#package-removal](docs/configuration.md#package-removal).
- **Pin image tags in production.** Use `ghcr.io/openchami/image-thrillhouse:v0.1.0` rather than `:latest` for reproducible builds.
